# Expense Tracker App
## using ReactJS, Typescript,Redux toolkit and React Router
## Project # 24 from '25 Projects in React' that I watched.

This project made me practice more about the redux toolkit and react-router.

I didn't copy all of the features and designs in the project that I watched, I reinvented the project as my own, that technique made me practice more about what I want to achieve or learn. And besides I'm a newbie in this React thing, and I want to go deeper to learn all about it before I jump to another lesson.
